This project is built based on the Usecase(3) of the Frontend part as per the PDF provided by DSC Team.
This project is built on React JS and I have used css and react-routers for styling and linking the pages respectively. In it I have made the use of formspree to record the responses that the user enters and submits. Also, a login page is also created which will take the user to the mentioned registration page.Although, the details filled in the login page will not be stored anywhere but the user will have to enter correct details only then he/she will be directed to the registration page.I have tried to make the website as user-interactive as possible, hence when the details are submitted on the registration page, they will be recorded on the formspree server and sent on mail of the site owner(i.e,Me). I have additionally created a front page so that the attendees can have some knowledge of what the workshop is about. 

The live preview of the website is at the link: https://dsc-attendance-manager.netlify.app/
